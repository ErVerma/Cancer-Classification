===============================

### PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Test the accuracy of the Nearest Neighbor and K Nearest Neighbor algorithms on a dataset.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
================== 
Run the main method in the NearestNeighborTester class. As a command line input, enter the name of the dataset, which should be wdbc.data
The program will then run, and print out the average accuracy of the algorithm.

How the Program Works

Firstly, the selected dataset is divided into two
parts first part containing 80% data will be used
as a training data set, and the second part
containing the other 20% will be the prediction
set.
Then K-nearest neighbour algorithm is applied
on data set to check whether data item in the
second part, the prediction set were malignant
or benign, by checking whether the nearest
neighbours algorithm to it were benign or
malignant.
This result would be then compared with
prediction set containing the actual tumours
value, and accordingly, accuracy is being
calculated in percentage.
